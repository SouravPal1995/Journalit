            Journals are one of the oldest practices known to the human race. Journals allowed our ancestors to 
            commit there experiences and memories to paper so that future generations could learn from them and build upon there triumps and failures. 
            Maintaining journals have also been known to have therapeutic properties as it allows one to deal 
            with their daily struggles and stressful experiences. Maintaining a journal is cost effective and healthier 
            than spending countless hours of mindless internet surfing. Journalit is an opensource project that allows
