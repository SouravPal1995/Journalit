            Journals are one of the oldest practices known to the human race. Journals allowed our ancestors to commit there experiences and 
            memories to paper so that future generations could learn from them and build upon there triumps and failures. Maintaining journals have also 
            been known to have therapeutic properties as it allows one to deal with their daily struggles and stressful experiences. Maintaining a journal
            is cost effective and healthier than spending countless hours of mindless internet surfing. Journalit is an opensource project that allows us to do just that without
